DONE 1: Create window (winit) add gameloop and render triangle, with fixed camera, ability to close window
DONE 3: Add Asset implementation so meshes have handles and can be assigned to entities.
DONE 4: Add Entity implementation
DONE 2: Generate simple noisy terrain still with fixed camera
DONE 9: Update to wgpu 0.7
DONE 7: Start lighting implementation to have good looking low poly graphics
[x] implement basic spot / directional / point with specular/diffuse/amient (light and material)
[x] define a light in rust which automatically uploads to gpu (uniform buffer array)
DONE 11: Implement seperate pipeline for rendering the lights
[x] finish mesh from cube which represents the lights
[x] move model matrix to instance data
[x] finish seperate pipeline implementation
[x] render multiple lights
[x] render lights using instanced rendering
TODO 11: Refactor instanced rendering and light / entities
[] make adding entities and lights awesome
TODO 10: advanced light rendering
[] more advanced light rendering
[] shadow mapping
TODO 8: Move model data to instance data and add instance data to gpu (instances rendering)
TODO 5: Add transform implementation and can be added to entities
TODO 6: Add Graph so entities can have parent child relation
