DONE 0: rts movement / camera
DONE 2: drag select
DONE 1: leftclick/rightclick select
DONE 5: add one unit at start of map to be selected
DONE 6: zoom out in using scroll mouse
DONE 3: unit selection
[x] Rectangle and click select target
DONE 4: selected unit gets point to move to and moves to it
[x] Right click must give action to move to
[x] Assign selected units a position to move to if action move is given
[x] make physics loop to slowly move to position and stop when close enough to location
DONE 7: make player controller commands enum, so they can be different and optional
[x] make command enum
[x] investigate if events are better for sending commands + currently sending events from input to client
[x] (Refactoring) make move/rectangle select/select/draw rectangle all work via events
DONE 8: let camera control also work via events instead of state via resource
[x] refactor zoom
[x] let moving center also work via events
[x] put center entity and potentially others in GameInfo resource
DONE 9: fix rectangle select, also react on right mouse release without LCTRL
DONE 10: implement simple seeking behaviour
DONE 11: implement flocking behaviour seperation
[x] identify different units by id
[x] implement seperation
DONE 15: implement steering behaviour based on forces, instead of rotation/angle
DONE 12: implement flocking cohesion
DONE 13: implement flocking alignment
DONE 14: implement collision avoidance
TODO 15: implement buildings static
TODO 16: implement flowfield navigation
[x] implement array of values with print debugging
[x] implement set destination and calculate values of other fields
[] render tiles with text on top, for debugging purposes
[] integrate flowfield into game
TODO 17: start implementation magickavoxel integration
